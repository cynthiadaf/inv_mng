NEXT STEPS
new repo!
- Finish CRUD for booking
- Trainer book a client through a specific session
- Trainer Detail page

- Allow Clients 
-- Create their account
-- Be added to a class by a teacher
-- View sessions
-- Create their own session
-- Update their own session
-- Delete their own session




LONG TERM
Separate the Log in as client and log in as trainer UX
Client can see trainer pages and trainers cant see client pages
Trainers can create an account for a client and clients can log in to book stuff (or clients can create their own account)


- create templates for each point in user journey
- Add buttons that display the templates
- Display the templates view (see HomePage view)
- Add the urls to access the views
- Connect the urls to the buttons


AUTH & SAFETY
-Enable the permissions Via Django Admin
-Send email confirmation about sign ups

Review To-Do list









IMPORTANT
- Make sure you can't add participants to a full class, without removing one
- Make sure to only add sessions that have not been added to future invoices. (or atleast filter when creating in front end)
- Create multiple sessions at once option
- Can't create two sessions hapeening at the same time.
- Add Logo to invoices
- What if a trainer wants to add their client and they are already in the DB due to another trainer.
-- It should say the client email is already registered but then allow them to add them to the new trainer.
-- This is where the select client and client can self book form would be most useful.
--If the client email exists re-direct to the (Client select and selfbooking form instead).
